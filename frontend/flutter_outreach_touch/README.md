# Frontend For Outreach Touch
The frontend for the application is built with Dart (Flutter). This is a project that I started with in order to learn how to use Flutter and how to code in Dart. 
The main page that is initially displayed is actually from the Flutter startup tutorial, with my own addition being the third, "Missions" page. From this page, the different
available missions can be viewed, and selected in order to read more about the history of the respective mission. (These historical origins are not yet completed for all of the missions).

It is however a proof of concept, and was mainly created to see what could be added functionality wise in order to make a holistic and viable Outreach application.
